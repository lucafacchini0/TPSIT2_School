Welcome to the TPSIT_4 repository, a personal project dedicated to the publication of academic exercises. This repository aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for my academy progress, and my teachers. This subject focus on topics such as scripting, Java, C++, and others, to provide a wide range of exercises designed to enhance skills and reinforce core concepts. Feel free to explore and utilize the exercises!
